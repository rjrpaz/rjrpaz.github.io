My name is Roberto Paz.

I live in Cordoba, Argentina.

I'm working with open source platforms from more than 25 years now.  Most of my professional career was as a freelance programmer strongly oriented to electronic developments (I'm in fact an electronic engineer).

I will use this site to start documenting some stuff I did during all these years and may help someone else.

Some of the things you will see here are seems to be a little old because, well, I'm that old. Let's hope is just a small part though.
